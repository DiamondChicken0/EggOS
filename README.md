Monitoring Software for Chickens (MSC)

Chicken Eggs are enivormentally sustainable, especially when compared to meat products. This program is designed to show the current and past conditions of chickens in a given enviroment on a scale of good, meh, bad.

This software is designed mostly for the average person, with a couple of chickens, but with some more programming could be effectively scaled up. However, the user-friendly GUI interfacce lends itself better for the average person.

This software is currently coded for demonstrative purposes, with generated results of the calendar.
However, starting the Data.Main method as a thread, and connecting your own temperature + weather sensor to the Data.py, and deleting any lines metntioning generating data
it should update the calendar in a appropiate way.
